a. This program will read take a directory from a user and scan for subdirectories train and test, upon locating the directories the program will scan every file in the training folder and count how many times a word appears in each file. It then calculates the probability that the world will appear in a given spam/ham file. Once the training phase is over the program moves onto the testing folder and begins the testing phase. It will then scan every file again but instead will count the number of times the word appears in total. It will then do some calculations to generate a probability value (1 - 0) if the file is spam or not. Finally it displays all files spam values and parent directories in a TableView window.
